                <p>
                    The 21st century is earmarked as Information Technology driven and India is at the Centre of global attraction
                    and considered as a knowledge powerhouse. The IT industry covers IT services, IT-enabled services (ITES), e-commerce
                    (online business), Software and Hardware products. IT based services are indispensable for any organization to increase
                    productivity, ease of doing business, and grow efficiently and economically in this competitive world. Information
                    Technology not only contributed to the economic growth of the country but it has also made governance more competent and
                    approachable. It has made access to government services and information easier and inexpensive. Information technology has
                    also made management and delivery of government services – such as health services, Educational information, consumer rights
                    and services etc. more meritorious with enhancing transparency. The IT industry is the backbone for our economy to prosper
                    exponentially and to generate millions of jobs. Growth in the IT sector will push us to grow at par with China in every
                    sector and will help in grabbing the global market. This will improve the socio-economic status of Indians.

            <p>
                The exponential growth of the IT industry in India in the last two decades has changed the perception of
                the whole world about India’s storehouse of knowledge and skills and powered economic growth.
                The swift advancement within the IT industry and liberalisation policies such as reducing trade barriers and
                eliminating import duties on technology products by the Government of India are instrumental in the evolution
                of this industry. Also, various other government initiatives like setting up Software Technology Parks (STP),
                Export Oriented Units (EOU), Special Economic Zones (SEZ) and foreign direct investment (FDI) have helped this
                industry in attaining a leading position in the world IT industry.
                The IT sector has increased its contribution to India’s GDP from 1.2% in 1998 to almost 10% in 2019.
                According to NASSCOM, the sector aggregated revenues of 180 billion dollars in 2019 with export revenue standing at 99
                billion dollars and domestic revenue 48 US billion dollars, growing by over 13%. As of 2020, India’s IT workforce accounts
                for 4.36 million employees. The United States accounts for two-third of India’s IT services exports.

                Future belongs to India with a great share of work from different parts of the world and placement of
                Indian experts across the globe. Central government has initiated a transformation process in the education sector.
                In the next few years, the last year of a degree course will be treated as an R & D year and the syllabus is being developed
                based on the latest technological advancements, skills and knowledge. This will surely add value to our graduates not
                just as job seekers however will be job creators.
