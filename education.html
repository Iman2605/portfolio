            <p>
                With a strong foundation in computer science principles, I have developed a deep understanding of various programming
                languages such as Python, Java, and C++.
                In addition to these languages, I have also gained proficiency in Django, a high-level Python web framework that
                encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. My experience with Django has equipped me with the skills to
                build robust and scalable web applications. I have also honed my skills in React, a popular JavaScript library for
                building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. My ability to create complex UI components in React
                and manage application state effectively makes me a competent front-end developer. Furthermore, I have a good understanding
                of version control systems like Git, which has helped me to collaborate effectively with other developers and maintain
                a streamlined codebase. My problem-solving skills, combined with my ability to learn new technologies quickly,
                make me a valuable asset in any programming team.

            <p>
                I am a strong communicator, able to articulate complex ideas clearly and effectively.
                I am also a good listener, understanding the importance of hearing others’ perspectives and ideas.
                I have a strong work ethic and am committed to delivering high-quality results on time. I am self-motivated and proactive,
                always looking for ways to improve my skills and contribute to my team.
                I am a team player, understanding that collaboration often leads to the best outcomes.
                I am comfortable working in diverse teams and value the unique insights that each team member brings.
                I am also adaptable, able to adjust to new situations and challenges with ease. I understand that change is
                a constant in the tech industry, and I embrace it as an opportunity for growth.
                Finally, I have strong problem-solving skills. I enjoy tackling complex problems and finding innovative solutions.
                I approach challenges with a positive attitude, viewing them as opportunities to learn and grow.

            <p>
                My graduation paper was based on accelerators; what they are, how they work etc. Even though I'm not
                a big fan of Physics, this topic seemed interesting, so I decided to do it. What fascinated me
                the most while doing my research was how relatively fast this field is developing. In a picture below,
                you can see Future Circular Collider which is going to cost more than $22 billion. It is expected
                to be completed around 2050. I am also thankful for that I had a great mentor, who in  fact visited CERN himself,
                so he had a lot of knowledge that he unselfishly shared with me.
